# LTW Project

## Description

Create a website where restaurants can list and offer their menus for take-away. To create this application, students should:

- Create an SQLite database that stores information about restaurants, menus, dishes, customers, and orders.
- Create documents using HTML and CSS representing the application's web pages.
- Use PHP to generate those web pages after retrieving/changing data from the database.
- Use Javascript to enhance the user experience (for example, using Ajax).
